# AI Training

This repository collects experiments, notes, and supporting code for personal AI model training projects. The goal is to document workflows, track progress, and keep related assets under version control as they evolve.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install the tools required for your current experiment.
2. Add any datasets, configuration files, or scripts relevant to the training run.
3. Record experiment details, outcomes, and lessons learned in clearly named folders or markdown files.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep large datasets out of version control; store them externally and reference their location.
- Document each experiment so results can be reproduced later.
- Use feature branches for substantial changes, and merge them via pull requests on GitHub.
